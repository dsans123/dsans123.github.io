                of his armour with lions in order to emulate his hero. Radahn grew huge due to his demigod stature
                and not wanting to abondin his trusty steed Leonard, Radahn set out to learn gravity magic in Selia.
                Mastering

                as well as challenge the very starts themselves. Radahn conquered the starts and saved Selia in the
                process.
                This earned him the moniker Starscourge.

                champions
                who wished for the title of Elden Lord.
